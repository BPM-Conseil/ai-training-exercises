# Winsurf - Exercise 3

Create a portfolio website using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

1. Generate a simple HTML page structure without mobile support and basic CSS for a personal portfolio with header, about me, projects, and contact sections in an Exercise_3 folder.
2. Add CSS styles to center the content, add a light background, and style the header with a bold font.
3. Make the web page layout responsive for mobile devices with stacked sections.
4. Run the code in a browser and iterate on improvements using Windsurf suggestions and fixes.
